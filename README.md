Allows the meteorologists to monitor weather appropriately.
#### Getting Started
To use the APIs, follow these steps:
Authentication: Obtain an API key by signing up on our platform
Usage: Integrate the provided endpoints into your application using the API key for authentication.


#### Execution: 
The script is executed from the command line, and the user interacts with the program through the console.
Potential Enhancements: 
The prototype could be extended by adding more feature about weather
Code Organization: 
The code is well-organized and follows PEP 8 style conventions, making it clear and readable.
Limitations: 
The current prototype lacks comprehensive error handling and validation. Future iterations might consider more robust error handling, input validation, and edge case handling.
This prototype serves as a foundation for a simplei world weather app station information application.
